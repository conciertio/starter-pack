Note, at first glance it's easy to think nginx_tmpl can be templated with all api machines during build, but it has to be done per cluster, and that information isn't available during build.

So, HOSTS env var is created per cluster during deploy and the run script splits that and generates the nginx.conf as the container instantiates.
